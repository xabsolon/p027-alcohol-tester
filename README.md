# Arduino Alcohol Tester

This is a project for creating an alcohol tester using Arduino. The project measures the alcohol content in the breath and provides a corresponding reading.

## Libraries

To run this project, you will need the following libraries:

- [Adafruit_GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)
- [Adafruit_SSD1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306)
- [Adafruit_BusIO](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BusIO)

Please make sure to install these libraries before running the project.

## Usage

1. Connect the Arduino board to the alcohol sensor module and the OLED display.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino board using Arduino IDE.
3. Open the serial monitor to view the alcohol content readings.
4. The OLED display will show the alcohol content in real-time.
